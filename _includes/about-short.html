<div class="about-short">
    Hello and welcome to my website! I am a <strong>Robotics Engineer</strong> with a deep passion for <span class="highlight-skill">engineering, automation, mathematics, and control</span>. I am fascinated by the algorithms and control systems that bring robots to life, enabling them to act with precision and intelligence. What excites me most is translating these ideas into reality through engineering.
    I recently completed my <span class="highlight-institution">Master's degree specializing in Robotics at UC San Diego</span> in March 2025 and am <span class="highlight-current">currently working with Lucid Motors</span>.
    Outside of Robotics, I swim, play football(soccer) and I'm an avid reader - so feel free to drop in your favorite book recommendations.
