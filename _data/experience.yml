    I primarily worked on automating a major portion of software unit-testing for production software on all Lucid ECUs. I developed an extensive understanding
    of automotive production software standards and vehicle network protocols (CAN, LIN, Ethernet)
    -  Covered > 30% software components across all vehicles ECUs
    -  Saved > 16 man hours of unit-testing per software component

    In this internship I focussed on developing a scalable and robust MPC-based controller for executing specific on-road behaviors in AV simulation. The work culminated into a 
    highly robust and low-latency MPC architecture with significant performance improvement over the traditional PID controllers. I learned about optimization solvers, vehicle dynamical
    models and trajectory generation techniques.

    -  Robust MPC with on-the-go trajectory generation, obstacle avoidance and low latency

    As a Vehicle Controls intern I worked on a Motor-sizing model which could help choose the right motor based on lap-performance requirements for the Podium (Canada) EV racing team.
    Alongside, I also curated comprehensive project-based learning modules for Motion Planning, SLAM, Perception. I learned ROS, Docker and Gazebo and implemented an A-star motion planner
    based on data from Google maps
