  title: Visual-Inertial SLAM with Kalman Filters (KF, EKF)
  summary: "We estimate the vehicle trajectory and landmark locations using an Extended Kalman Filter
            where the motion model is given by pose dynamics in SE(3)
            deduced using IMU readings and the landmark obsertvations are done by a stereo camera"

  title: Homing, Waypoint following in an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle
  summary: "We autonomously guide a RexRov AUV equipped with 8 thrusters to a set home/dock position
            on the water surface using s sliding-mode control algorithm. We also perform
            seabed mapping using a SONAR attached on the AUV while following underwater waypoints"

  title: Trajectory Tracking with Finite and Infinite horizon Optimal Control
  summary: "We track the trajectory of a marker tracing a lissjous curve in an environment with multiple obstacles.
            This is done using a Model-Predictive Controller and by training a control policy using Generalized
            policy iteration"
