        My research interests include <span class="highlight-skill">Motion Planning</span>, <span class="highlight-skill">Learning-Based SLAM and sensor-fusion techniques</span>, <span class="highlight-skill">Advanced Control</span>, and <span class="highlight-skill">Modeling and Simulation</span>. My academic and professional journey has provided me with extensive hands-on experience with <strong>ground robots, autonomous vehicles, mobile manipulators and autonomous underwater vehicles</strong>. Before UCSD, I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from <span class="highlight-institution">IIT Bombay</span> in 2023, where I dived deeper into <em>Systems and Control engineering</em> — a journey that naturally evolved into my pursuit of Robotics.

        I enjoy tinkering with new ideas and projects in each of these areas, and <strong>this site is where I chronicle my work and learnings</strong> — from the smallest insights and discoveries to larger, more complex projects. If you're interested in robotics, I hope you'll find something valuable here. To dive deeper into my projects, research, and experiences, visit the <strong>Projects page</strong>. I am always eager to connect with fellow enthusiasts and professionals in the field, so please feel free to reach out!
